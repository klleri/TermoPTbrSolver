# Termo Solver Project (Work in Progress)

## Description

This project aims to create a solver for the Brazilian Portuguese word game **Termo** (similar to Wordle).

This repository currently contains the **first part** of the project: preparing a suitable word list. The main script for this initial phase is `process_word_list.py`.

## Current Status: Word List Processing

The script `process_word_list.py` performs the necessary initial processing on a raw list of Portuguese words. Its tasks are:

1.  Read an input file named `palavras.txt` (expected to contain one Portuguese word per line, UTF-8 encoded).
2.  Filter out words that do not have exactly 5 letters.
3.  Convert all 5-letter words to lowercase.
4.  Remove accents from the words (e.g., "caf√©" becomes "cafe").
5.  Remove any duplicate words after processing.
6.  Write the resulting unique, 5-letter, accent-free words to a new file named `palavras_5letras.txt`, sorted alphabetically.

This cleaned file, `palavras_5letras.txt`, provides the valid word list required for the actual game solver.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3
* A raw Portuguese word list file named `palavras.txt` located in the same directory as the script. This file must be **UTF-8 encoded**, with one word per line.

## Future Work: The Solver

The next phase of this project involves creating the actual **Termo solver script**. This future script will:

* Use the cleaned word list (`palavras_5letras.txt`) generated by `process_word_list.py`.
* Implement logic to suggest possible Termo answers based on user input about correct letters (green), misplaced letters (yellow), and incorrect letters (gray) from previous guesses.
